## Bot

The Discord bot is built on the [Discord.py v2][discordpy] library.

## Web

The web service is a [Litestar][litestar] application. It is utilizing Jinja2[jinja] templating, TailwindCSS[tailwind],
[DaisyUI[daisy], and [Feather icons][feather] for the front end, and the backend is using the Litestar-provided 
utilities for routing, middleware, and more.
