## Bot

The Discord bot is built on the [Discord.py v2][discordpy] library.

## Web

The web service is a [Litestar][litestar] application. It is utilizing Jinja2[jinja] templating, TailwindCSS[tailwind],
[DaisyUI][daisy], and [Feather icons][feather] for the front end, and the backend is using the Litestar-provided
utilities for routing, middleware, and more.

## Deployment

Byte is currently deployed to [Railway][railway] for both the bot and the web service in production
and testing.

## Development

You can use the provided [nixpack][nixpacks] config [file](./nixpacks.toml) config,
or set up your environment using PDM[pdm].
